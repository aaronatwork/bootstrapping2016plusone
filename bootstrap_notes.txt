Keep in mind that Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first. Mobile-first styles are found throughout the entire Bootstrap library instead of in separate files.
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, also add the viewport meta tag inside the <head> element:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
The width=device-width sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


Put Your HTML Elements Inside Containers
Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

There are two containers to choose from:

1. Use the .container class for a responsive fixed width container:
<div class="container">

2. Use the .container-fluid class for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport:
<div class="container-fluid">
